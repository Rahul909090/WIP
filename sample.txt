This is a sample text file used as input for Project 2. It contains regular
English text in sentences and paragraphs that are analyzed by the program.

The program counts the number of lines in the input file, as well as the
total number of words. It also counts the number of long words in the file.
A word is considered long if it has more than five characters. The program
also counts the number of sentences by counting the number of periods in
the file.

Finally, the program counts the number of capitalized words in the input
file. It uses a separate method to determine if a word is capitalized.

Blank lines will count toward the line count, but do not contribute any
words.

This program uses Scanner objects in three ways. One Scanner object is used
to read the file name that the user types at the keyboard. Another Scanner
is used to read each line in the file, and the third is used to parse the
individual words on the line.

This concludes this sample input file. Have a nice day.
